          <p><strong>Childhood</strong><br>Jackie Chan was born on April 7, 1954 in British Hong Kong. He was born to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan and they named him Chan Kong-Sang at birth. He was sent the Nah-Hwa Primary School but Chan failed in his first year itself. He was a very energetic kid, running around imitating people and singing songs. This prompted his parents to admit him to the China Drama Academy in Peking. Chan trained here for the next ten years of his life specialising in acrobatics and martial arts.</p>
          <p><strong>Beginning</strong><br>At the age of 17 he got an opportunity to work as a stuntman in Bruce Lee films like ‘Fist of Fury’ and ‘Enter the Dragon’. But soon he found it difficult to find good movies to act in which suited his martial arts.</p>
          <p><strong>Career</strong><br>In the 1978 film ‘Snake in the Eagle’s Shadow’ Chan found his first success as a result of bringing in the comedic Kung Fu genre into big screen. Next Chan starred in ‘Drunken Master’ which helped him establish himself as one of the rising stars in the industry. All these movies were equally successful at the box office. With his success at home he tried to enter the American film industry with the film ‘The Cannonball Run’ (1982). But he was not given mainstream roles, so he went back to his home country.</p>
          <p><strong>Achievements</strong><br>The year 1995 was a special year for Jackie Chan as he got his break in the American film industry with the success of the movie ‘Rumble in Bronx’. He now got an opportunity to star in the movie ‘Rush Hour’ which went on to gross more than $125 million. His next films were ‘Shanghai Noon’, ‘Shanghai Knights’, ‘Rush Hour 2’ which were all blockbusters at the box-office. This made him a superstar in Hollywood also.</p>
